        <p>
            Call me back, darlin', when you hear me call your name
    If I don't hear you, I'll think somebody came
    If I can't find you, I'll wait on down the hill
    And if you don't find me, I'll think you've been killed
    And if you don't find me, I'll run on down the road
    Find me the sheriff, <span>tell him what I know</span>
    Find me the preacher and pray for your soul
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    We don't know why, we don't know why
    Come back, my baby, come back alive
    Dogs go out searching, men walk the land
    I hold your Bible tight in my hand
    Cry every morning, cry every night
    'Cause I know for certain something ain't right
    When you'd been sleeping <span>candle</span> burned low
    Devil came calling and I didn't know
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    We don't know why, we don't know why
    Come back, my baby, come back alive
    Six cold months later cried all my tears
    Had my suspicions, had all my fears
    Six cold months later something still wrong
    Planted the seed corn, nothing will grow
    Six cold months later, what do I see?
    Fog in the distance, eyes stare at me
    Fall to my knees and I call out your name
    Call me back, darling
    Call me back, darling
    Call me back, darling
    <span>Y</span>ou ain't the same
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    We don't know why, we don't know why
    Come back, my baby, come back alive
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    No safe place child, no safe place child
    We don't know why, we don't know why
    Come back, my baby, come back alive
